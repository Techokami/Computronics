Techokami's Computronics repository.

This is a fork of Computronics by asie, except it supports Minecraft 1.7.2, doesn't really support ComputerCraft anymore, and has the latest AsieLib rolled into it (so don't add AsieLib to your Minecraft install, it's already here and all existing mods by asie will use it just fine!)
